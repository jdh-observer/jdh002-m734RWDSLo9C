## Abstract

This paper introduces [_imagineRio Narratives_](https://narratives.imaginerio.org/), a map-based writing application designed for scholars, students, and dedicated amateurs interested in the city of Rio de Janeiro's history. Our tool allows users to write their own narratives using geographic data from the [_imagineRio_](https://imaginerio.org/) historical mapping platform, encouraging visual storytelling through an intuitive user interface that does not require GIS expertise. In this paper, the _narrative_ layer discusses the idea behind the project, our previous experience using ESRI StoryMaps, and how the Covid-19 pandemic influenced our development process. The _hermeneutics_ layer presents the technical choices shaping our design and data model, and describes how we collected feedback from users in Brazil. We conclude by sharing our vision for _imagineRio_ as an inclusive platform that fosters open research and scholarship.
